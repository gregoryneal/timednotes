Planned features:

-integrate with smartphone app for an all-in-one note keeping application for phone and computer

-custom notebook properties, instead of a fixed time and a note property, what about a 2 notes, and a checkbox? or a time, label, checkbox and progress bar? these would be possible with custom notebook properties
